Introduction
====================
Let's Share is an iPhone application for sharing contacts and photo's over a bluetooth connection.


Technology
--------------------
Let's share uses GameKit to pair with other devices and transfer data over BlueTooth and WiFi. GameKit makes discovery easy. Although Bonjour would have been the better choice, I never came to that transition.


By using NSKeyedArchiver to serialize the ABRecordRef objects and transmit them using GameKit. Photo's are transmitted/beamed using NSData.

If been optimizing the communication protocol to allow for better error handling.

About
---------------------

This was the first iOS project I had published to App Store. I used it to learn the development and the App Store approval process. And I hope it will help and inspire others to do the same.
